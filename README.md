# Psychic-Game

UCF Coding Boot Camp - Week Three Homework Assignment (Basic)

## Overview
Create a computer game (Psychic) which will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code


## Instructions
The computer will randomly choose a letter from the alphabet. The goal is for the user to guess that letter by pressing a key on the keyboard.

The user is allowed 9 chances to guess the correct letter. The game will display each incorrect guess the user makes.

Each time the user guesses a letter correctly, their win count increases by one, and the screen will receive an alert that they won and must be psychic.  If they fail to guess the correct letter in 9 chances, their losses count increases by one and there will an alert to notify them they lost and they are not psychic.

If the user wins or loses, when the alert is closed the game will reset without reloading the page.
